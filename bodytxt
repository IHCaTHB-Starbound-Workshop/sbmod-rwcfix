With Gecko gone MIA I was unable to obtain official permission. I intend to release the mod back to him should he resurface. If simply editting his work turns out to be problematic I will do a full rewrite instead.

Only changes made so far were to remove a lot of redundency and update to include melee weapons.

Explicitly compatible with Grand Armory!

Want some sweet weaponry but too lazy to get it yourself? No problem! This mod adds an idiot-proof box which you can use to craft random weapons!\n\nConstruct the Weapon Box in a T2 Inventor's Table, and then buy as many bags of delicious guns as you can!\n\n\nThe drop pools are as follows:\nSmall Arms: Pistols, Machine Pistols, Assault Rifles\nLong Guns: Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns\nHeavy Weapons: Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, Sniper Rifles\n\n\nAs you may have noticed in the title, this is an EARLY RELEASE. There may be problems and some things I plan to add are missing.\nOne of the more pressing things: Adding weapons from my other mods to the lists, so that they can drop from weapon bags.\n\n\nNEW IN 0.8\n-------------\nBags are now visible when held.\nAdded a compatibility package hooking GDRWC to my weapon mods, it can be downloaded here:\nNote- Requires ALL of my weapon mods.\n\nIssue Tracker:\nWeapon Box does not animate when opened.\nHeavyWeapon and LongGun reward bags use the same sprite.\n\nIf you experience any issues that aren't mentioned here please leave a comment.\n\n\n\n\nWant to support my work? \nhttps://www.patreon.com/superepicgecko \n\nCheck out my other God Dame mods: \n--------- \n\nGod Dame Revolvers \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=758365731 \n\nGod Dame Flamethrowers \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757827721 \n\nGod Dame Anti-Material Rifles \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757158576 \n\nGod Dame Battle Rifles \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756506894 \n\nGod Dame Submachine Guns \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753785891 \n\nGod Dame Critter Capture \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755417501 \n\nGod Dame Reclamation \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754747438 \n\nGod Dame Weapon Names \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=752680238 \n\nGod Dame Space Stations \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754170513 \n\nGod Dame Bullion \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751753950 \n\nGod Dame Zoom \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754477562 \n\n\n---------- \nComments, Suggestions?
