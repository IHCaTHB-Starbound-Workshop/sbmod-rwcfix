  "description" : "With Gecko gone MIA I was unable to obtain official permission. I intend to release the mod back to him should he resurface. If simply editting his work turns out to be problematic I will do a full rewrite instead.\n\nOnly changes made so far were to remove a lot of redundency and update to include melee weapons.\n\nExplicitly compatible with Grand Armory!\n\nFor more, click the MEGATHREAD link from the steam page.\n\nOriginal mod text:\n\nWant some sweet weaponry but too lazy to get it yourself? No problem! This mod adds an idiot-proof box which you can use to craft random weapons!\n\nConstruct the Weapon Box in a T2 Inventor's Table, and then buy as many bags of delicious guns as you can!\n\n\nThe drop pools are as follows:\nSmall Arms: Pistols, Machine Pistols, Assault Rifles\nLong Guns: Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns\nHeavy Weapons: Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, Sniper Rifles\n\n\nAs you may have noticed in the title, this is an EARLY RELEASE. There may be problems and some things I plan to add are missing.\nOne of the more pressing things: Adding weapons from my other mods to the lists, so that they can drop from weapon bags.\n\n\nNEW IN 0.8\n-------------\nBags are now visible when held.\nAdded a compatibility package hooking GDRWC to my weapon mods, it can be downloaded here:\nNote- Requires ALL of my weapon mods.\n\nIssue Tracker:\nWeapon Box does not animate when opened.\nHeavyWeapon and LongGun reward bags use the same sprite.\n\nIf you experience any issues that aren't mentioned here please leave a comment.\n\n\n\n\nWant to support my work? \nhttps://www.patreon.com/superepicgecko \n\nCheck out my other God Dame mods: \n--------- \n\nGod Dame Revolvers \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=758365731 \n\nGod Dame Flamethrowers \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757827721 \n\nGod Dame Anti-Material Rifles \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757158576 \n\nGod Dame Battle Rifles \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756506894 \n\nGod Dame Submachine Guns \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753785891 \n\nGod Dame Critter Capture \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755417501 \n\nGod Dame Reclamation \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754747438 \n\nGod Dame Weapon Names \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=752680238 \n\nGod Dame Space Stations \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754170513 \n\nGod Dame Bullion \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751753950 \n\nGod Dame Zoom \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754477562 \n\n\n---------- \nComments, Suggestions?
